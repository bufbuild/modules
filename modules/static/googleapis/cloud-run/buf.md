**This is a third-party repository managed by Buf.**

This module contains types from the
[googleapis/cloud/run](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/cloud) inner
package.

The [source repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) is already being synced onto
`googleapis/googleapis`, which is a dependency of this module. To use Google's `cloud-run` APIs,
create your own module that has a `dep` on `buf.build/googleapis/cloud-run`.

Updates to the [source repository](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis) are automatically
synced on a periodic basis, and each BSR commit is labeled with corresponding Git commits.

To depend on a specific Git commit, you can use it as your reference in your dependencies:

```
deps:
  - buf.build/googleapis/cloud-run:<GIT_COMMIT_LABEL>
```

For more information, see the [documentation](https://buf.build/docs/bsr/overview).

  # every time, regardless if there was a release or not, or even if the
  # release job failed. TODO: We can improve efficiency here by doing
  # two things: (1) only triggering sync job when there's a release
  # produced from the previous step, and (2) only syncing directories
  # (or even files) that changed in the rsync invocation.

# modules

## Description

This repository contains third-party modules synced and published to the [Buf Schema Registry][bsr].

If you'd like a common third-party module to be managed by Buf, open an issue using the [Managed Module Request for Buf 
Schema Registry][issue-template] issue template and our team will follow up.

## Managed modules

We currently sync automatically the following modules:

| Module | Source Community Repository | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| cncf/xds | https://github.com/cncf/xds | - envoyproxy/protoc-gen-validate<br>- googleapis/googleapis |
| envoyproxy/envoy | https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy | - cncf/xds<br>- googleapis/googleapis<br>- opencensus/opencensus<br>- opentelemetry/opentelemetry<br>- prometheus/client-model |
| envoyproxy/protoc-gen-validate | https://github.com/envoyproxy/protoc-gen-validate |  |
| gogo/protobuf | https://github.com/gogo/protobuf |  |
| googleapis/googleapis | https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis |  |
| grpc/grpc | https://github.com/grpc/grpc-proto | - envoyproxy/envoy<br>- googleapis/googleapis |
| grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway | https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway | - googleapis/googleapis |
| opencensus/opencensus | https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-proto |  |
| opentelemetry/opentelemetry | https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto |  |
| prometheus/client-model | https://github.com/prometheus/client_model |  |
| protocolbuffers/wellknowntypes | https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf |  |

### How we handle dependencies

Dependencies are an essential part of these community modules as they help developers reuse well
known Protobuf types, reduce errors and speed up the development process. We do not control the
source of these modules, and managing and pinning dependencies to their exact commit can be
difficult, especially when multiple module sources and build systems are involved.

To minimize issues with pinned dependencies on these modules, we sync them in the following order.
First, we sync standalone modules. After they succeed, we then sync the modules that depend on them,
which use the latest pushed dependency commit. As long as the dependencies donâ€™t have any breaking
change in the source code, this should be sufficient and stable for upstream modules.
